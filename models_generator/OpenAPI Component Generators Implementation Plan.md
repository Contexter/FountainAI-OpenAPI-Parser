
# OpenAPI Component Generators Implementation Plan

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing each component generator in the `models_generator` directory. Following this plan will ensure each generator is implemented systematically, with each OpenAPI component represented as a Python dataclass.

## Overview

Each script in `models_generator` corresponds to a specific OpenAPI component and generates a Python dataclass. The plan organizes generators into batches, allowing a manageable implementation and testing workflow. Each batch can be independently implemented, tested, and validated by running `generate_models.py` to compile the `models.py` file.

## Batch Implementation Plan

### Batch 1: Basic Components

These foundational components have simple fields, making them ideal for establishing a basic structure.

**Components**:
- `generate_contact.py`
- `generate_external_documentation.py`
- `generate_header.py`
- `generate_info.py`
- `generate_license.py`

**Steps**:
1. Implement each generator with fields defined according to the OpenAPI 3.1 specification.
2. Use `Optional` types for non-required fields and set default values as necessary.
3. Run `generate_models.py` and verify the structure of `models.py` after each addition.

### Batch 2: Linking and Structure Components

These components contain references to other models or structured types.

**Components**:
- `generate_callback.py`
- `generate_components.py`
- `generate_discriminator.py`
- `generate_encoding.py`
- `generate_example.py`

**Steps**:
1. Implement each generator, ensuring correct references to other models (e.g., `Discriminator` or `ExternalDocumentation`).
2. Run `generate_models.py` to check for accurate integration of references in `models.py`.

---

### Batch 3: Schema and Security Components

These involve JSON Schema and security elements, adding complexity.

**Components**:
- `generate_link.py`
- `generate_media_type.py`
- `generate_oauth_flows.py`
- `generate_openapi.py`
- `generate_operation.py`

**Steps**:
1. Implement fields carefully, especially for the `Schema` component, which includes JSON Schema elements.
2. After each component, run `generate_models.py` to confirm accurate representation in `models.py`.

---

### Batch 4: Path, Parameter, and Reference Components

These components relate to request paths, parameters, and reference structures.

**Components**:
- `generate_parameter.py`
- `generate_path_item.py`
- `generate_reference.py`
- `generate_request_body.py`
- `generate_response.py`

**Steps**:
1. Implement each script based on the OpenAPI specification for paths, parameters, and references.
2. Test each addition in `generate_models.py` to ensure correct inclusion in `models.py`.

---

### Batch 5: Security, Server, and Tag Components

These components involve security configurations and server details.

**Components**:
- `generate_schema.py`
- `generate_security_requirement.py`
- `generate_security_scheme.py`
- `generate_server.py`
- `generate_server_variable.py`

**Steps**:
1. Implement each generator and test for integration within `generate_models.py`.
2. Confirm that all fields align with OpenAPI security, server, and tagging requirements.

---

### Batch 6: Final Components

These include tagging, XML configurations, and other final elements to complete the OpenAPI structure.

**Components**:
- `generate_tag.py`
- `generate_webhook.py`
- `generate_xml.py`

**Steps**:
1. Implement and test each remaining generator.
2. Confirm that `models.py` accurately reflects the full OpenAPI structure after each addition.

---

## Testing and Validation

1. **Iterative Testing**: After implementing each batch, run `generate_models.py` and verify that `models.py` is correctly populated with the new dataclasses.
2. **Review for Errors**: Check for syntax and logical consistency, especially in nested references.
3. **Adjust as Needed**: If issues arise, revise the generator script and re-run `generate_models.py`.

Following this structured plan will help ensure that each component generator is implemented and validated in alignment with OpenAPI 3.1 requirements.
