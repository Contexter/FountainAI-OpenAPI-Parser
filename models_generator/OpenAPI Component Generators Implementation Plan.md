## Overview

Each script in `models_generator` corresponds to a specific OpenAPI component and generates a Python dataclass. The plan organizes generators into batches, allowing a manageable implementation and testing workflow. Each batch can be independently implemented, tested, and validated by running `generate_models.py` to compile the `models.py` file.

## Automation Strategy for Generator Updates

To efficiently maintain each generator script in alignment with the OpenAPI 3.1 specification, we have implemented an automation strategy. This approach ensures that each generator script is updated to its final state with minimal manual intervention.

### Automation Steps

1. **Batch-Specific Update Scripts**:
   - For each batch, create a script (e.g., `batch_1_update.py`, `batch_2_update.py`, etc.) that automatically populates each generator in the batch with its final content.
   - Each batch script defines the fields, types, and defaults for each OpenAPI component it handles and updates the respective generator script accordingly.

2. **Define Final Fields and Types**:
   - The fields, types, and default values are specified in a dictionary within each batch script.
   - These details are then used to populate each component’s generator script with the necessary dataclass fields.

3. **Run Each Batch Script**:
   - Execute each batch script to update its corresponding generator scripts (e.g., running `batch_1_update.py` will update all Batch 1 generator scripts to their final, fully defined state).

4. **Centralized Specification Option**:
   - If maintaining all fields and types in code becomes complex, an external JSON or YAML file can be created to act as a single source of truth.
   - The batch update scripts would then read from this file to ensure consistency and avoid redundancy.

This automation strategy ensures that all generator scripts in the `models_generator` directory can be updated in a structured, automated manner, reflecting the latest OpenAPI specifications.

## Requirements for Future Batch Update Scripts

To ensure consistency, maintainability, and reliability, each future `batch_x_update.py` script should adhere to the following requirements:

1. **Logging Configuration**:
   - Log all informational and error messages to a specified log file.
   - Allow the log file path to be configurable using an argument (e.g., `--log-file`), making it adaptable for various environments.
   - Set up logging to overwrite the log file on each run, or allow optional appending as needed.

2. **Dry-Run Mode**:
   - Implement a `--dry-run` option, which, when enabled, outputs intended changes to the console without actually writing to any files.
   - In dry-run mode, log the actions and print the generated content to allow review without making changes.

3. **Directory Validation**:
   - Ensure the `models_generator` directory exists before attempting to create or modify files within it.
   - Automatically create the directory if it is missing.

4. **Dynamic Import Management**:
   - Automatically include necessary imports based on the fields in each model.
   - Specifically check for types like `Optional` and `List` and add the appropriate imports (`from typing import Optional`, `from typing import List`) only if needed by the model’s fields.

5. **File Backup Before Overwrite**:
   - Before overwriting an existing generator script, create a backup by appending a `.bak` extension to the original file.
   - Log each backup creation, so the operation is traceable.

6. **Structured Content Generation Using a Template**:
   - Use a centralized template for generating the content of each generator script, allowing for easy updates and consistency across all batch scripts.
   - Format field definitions dynamically within the template, handling optional defaults as needed.

7. **Error Handling with Logging**:
   - Wrap file operations in try-except blocks and log any exceptions encountered to avoid silent failures.
   - Log errors with `logging.error` to make troubleshooting easier.

8. **Execution Summary**:
   - Log a completion message at the end of each script’s execution, summarizing whether the batch update was successful or if any errors occurred.
   - This summary provides quick feedback on the script’s outcome.

## Batch Implementation Plan

### Batch 1: Basic Components

These foundational components have simple fields, making them ideal for establishing a basic structure.

**Components**:
- `generate_contact.py`
- `generate_external_documentation.py`
- `generate_header.py`
- `generate_info.py`
- `generate_license.py`

**Steps**:
1. Run `batch_1_update.py` to automatically update each generator in Batch 1 with its final field definitions.
2. Run `generate_models.py` and verify the structure of `models.py` after each addition.

---

### Batch 2: Linking and Structure Components

These components contain references to other models or structured types.

**Components**:
- `generate_callback.py`
- `generate_components.py`
- `generate_discriminator.py`
- `generate_encoding.py`
- `generate_example.py`

**Steps**:
1. Run `batch_2_update.py` to update each generator with final fields and references.
2. Run `generate_models.py` to check for accurate integration of references in `models.py`.

---

### Batch 3: Schema and Security Components

These involve JSON Schema and security elements, adding complexity.

**Components**:
- `generate_link.py`
- `generate_media_type.py`
- `generate_oauth_flows.py`
- `generate_openapi.py`
- `generate_operation.py`

**Steps**:
1. Execute `batch_3_update.py` to finalize each generator’s fields.
2. Run `generate_models.py` to confirm accurate representation in `models.py`.

---

### Batch 4: Path, Parameter, and Reference Components

These components relate to request paths, parameters, and reference structures.

**Components**:
- `generate_parameter.py`
- `generate_path_item.py`
- `generate_reference.py`
- `generate_request_body.py`
- `generate_response.py`

**Steps**:
1. Run `batch_4_update.py` to populate each generator with its final fields.
2. Test each addition in `generate_models.py` to ensure correct inclusion in `models.py`.

---

### Batch 5: Security, Server, and Tag Components

These components involve security configurations and server details.

**Components**:
- `generate_schema.py`
- `generate_security_requirement.py`
- `generate_security_scheme.py`
- `generate_server.py`
- `generate_server_variable.py`

**Steps**:
1. Run `batch_5_update.py` to update each generator with finalized field structures.
2. Confirm that `generate_models.py` accurately includes all security, server, and tagging details.

---

### Batch 6: Final Components

These include tagging, XML configurations, and other final elements to complete the OpenAPI structure.

**Components**:
- `generate_tag.py`
- `generate_webhook.py`
- `generate_xml.py`

**Steps**:
1. Execute `batch_6_update.py` to populate each generator with complete fields.
2. Verify that `models.py` reflects the entire OpenAPI structure upon running `generate_models.py`.

---

## Testing and Validation

1. **Iterative Testing**: After running each batch’s update script and generating `models.py`, verify that `models.py` is populated with the updated dataclasses.
2. **Review for Errors**: Check for syntax errors and logical consistency, especially in components with nested references.
3. **Adjust as Needed**: Revise any issues within the batch update scripts or the generator scripts and re-run `generate_models.py` for validation.

Following this structured plan and automation strategy will ensure that each component generator is implemented and validated in alignment with OpenAPI 3.1 requirements.
