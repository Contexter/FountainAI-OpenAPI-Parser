# Setting Up GitHub Actions for CI/CD in FountainAI OpenAPI Parser Project

## Overview
Integrating GitHub Actions allows us to automate the testing process for the **FountainAI OpenAPI Parser** project. This helps ensure that all changes are consistently tested in a controlled environment, reducing local setup issues and maintaining code quality.

This guide explains how to set up a GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) to automate unit tests on a GitHub-provided runner.

## Step 1: Create the Workflow Directory and File
To create a GitHub Actions workflow for CI, you need to create a `.github/workflows` directory in the root of your project and add a configuration file for the workflow.

### File Structure
- **Path**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

This directory is where GitHub Actions workflows are stored for the project.

## Step 2: Add the Workflow Configuration File
Create a new file named `ci.yml` with the following content to define the steps for the CI process:

```yaml
name: FountainAI OpenAPI Parser CI

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'  # Use a version that is compatible with your project

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      - name: Run Unit Tests
        run: |
          python -m unittest discover tests/
```

## Step 3: Explanation of Workflow Configuration

### Workflow Triggers
- **`on`**: Specifies the events that trigger the workflow.
  - **`push`**: Runs the workflow on any push to the `main` branch.
  - **`pull_request`**: Runs the workflow when a pull request targets the `main` branch.

### Job Configuration
- **`jobs`**: Defines a job named `test` to be executed on a virtual environment.
- **`runs-on`**: Specifies the operating system environment (`ubuntu-latest`) for running the job.

### Steps in the Job
1. **Checkout Repository**
   - **`actions/checkout@v3`**: Checks out the repository to access the source code for testing.
2. **Set Up Python**
   - **`actions/setup-python@v4`**: Sets up the desired Python version (e.g., `3.9`). Ensure this matches the project's requirements.
3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Installs the project dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip`.
4. **Run Unit Tests**
   - Runs unit tests using the `unittest` framework in the `tests/` directory.

## Step 4: Commit and Push the Changes
After creating the `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file, you need to commit and push it to your repository.

```sh
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git commit -m "ci: Add GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD"
git push origin main
```

## Step 5: Verify the Workflow Execution
Once the changes are pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions will automatically start executing the workflow.

- Navigate to the **Actions** tab of your GitHub repository.
- You will see the workflow running; you can view the progress and the logs to identify any issues.
- If tests fail, GitHub will provide logs for debugging.

## Benefits of GitHub Actions for FountainAI
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests automatically on every push or pull request.
- **Cross-Environment Compatibility**: Test on a GitHub-provided environment, ensuring consistency.
- **Ease of Use**: GitHub Actions integrates seamlessly into GitHub repositories, simplifying CI/CD setup and use.

## Next Steps
- If your project grows, consider adding additional jobs to the workflow, such as code linting, type checking, and deployment processes.
- Add more test environments to test compatibility with different Python versions.

With this setup, the FountainAI OpenAPI Parser project will have a robust CI/CD pipeline that ensures every change is tested before merging, thereby maintaining code quality and stability.
