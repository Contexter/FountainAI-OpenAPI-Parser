## 1. Critical Core Functionality Tests

> **Objective**: Ensure the core parser functions handle standard OpenAPI structures and key edge cases effectively. These tests verify the primary purpose of the parser and should be thoroughly validated before expanding to other areas.

- **Expand Basic Parsing Tests in Parser Core**
  - **Action**: Add cases to `test_parser.py` to validate the basic parsing of `openapi.yaml` for standard OpenAPI documents. This is a foundational check for core functionality.

- **Add Path and Method Parsing Tests**
  - **Action**: Test multiple HTTP methods within a single path to ensure paths and methods are parsed correctly. Essential for endpoint parsing accuracy.

- **Develop Schema Validation Tests for Parser Core**
  - **Action**: Validate the parserâ€™s handling of different schema types, such as arrays, objects, and custom definitions, which are essential for diverse OpenAPI structures.

- **Expand Tests for Invalid Structure Handling**
  - **Action**: Test error handling for structurally invalid OpenAPI documents using `invalid_openapi.yaml`, covering key validation edge cases.

## 2. Essential Mocking Strategy for External Dependencies

> **Objective**: Achieve test isolation by mocking external dependencies, ensuring tests are independent of network calls or other external resources. A stable mocking strategy is essential to prevent tests from being impacted by external factors.

- **Identify External Dependencies for Mocking**
  - **Action**: Review `utils.py` and `parser.py` for any external calls, such as network requests or file I/O operations. Establishes a clear mapping of dependencies to isolate.

- **Set Up Mocking for Identified Dependencies**
  - **Action**: Implement mocks for dependencies identified, using `unittest.mock` to simulate external calls. This action allows reliable test outcomes by isolating dependencies.

- **Verify Effectiveness of Mock Isolation**
  - **Action**: Run tests to confirm effective isolation, verifying mocks prevent interaction with actual external dependencies.

## 3. Utility Function Tests for Consistency

> **Objective**: Ensure all utility functions are robust, can handle a range of input types, and support parser functionality accurately.

- **Expand Schema Conversion Tests in Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Add test cases in `test_utils.py` to validate schema conversion functions handle all input types accurately, which is essential for schema flexibility in the parser.

- **Develop Reference Resolution Tests for Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Expand tests for `$ref` handling, covering both nested and recursive references, which is critical for OpenAPI document parsing.

- **Add Path Manipulation Tests for Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Test the utility functions' handling of complex path structures to ensure accurate parsing and reference handling.

- **Implement Edge Case Tests for Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Add tests for unexpected inputs to ensure utility functions are resilient against uncommon or malformed data.

## 4. Comprehensive Integration Testing

> **Objective**: Validate the parserâ€™s entire workflow and confirm it can handle full OpenAPI documents, complex nested structures, and integrated error cases.

- **Expand Integration Tests for Full OpenAPI File Parsing**
  - **Action**: Add end-to-end tests in `test_integration.py` for complete OpenAPI 3.1 documents, ensuring the parser can handle typical file structures and workflows.

- **Develop Nested Reference Parsing Tests**
  - **Action**: Test deep and recursive `$ref` references to ensure the parser can accurately process nested elements in complex OpenAPI documents.

- **Develop Error Handling Tests for Integration Workflow**
  - **Action**: Validate parser error handling in response to invalid or partially valid documents, ensuring resilience and reliability in real-world scenarios.

- **Add Parameter and Response Extraction Tests**
  - **Action**: Confirm accurate extraction of parameters and responses from the OpenAPI document, which is crucial for API documentation accuracy.

---

## 5. Exception Handling and Error Reporting

> **Objective**: Ensure that each custom exception in `exceptions.py` is triggered correctly, with clear and helpful error messages for developers.

- **Test Each Custom Exception for Error Handling**
  - **Action**: Write tests for each custom exception in `exceptions.py` to confirm that they handle expected issues with clear messages.

- **Add Scenario-Based Tests for Exception Handling**
  - **Action**: Develop tests in `test_parser.py` and `test_utils.py` that trigger each custom exception in real-use scenarios to verify robust error reporting.

This prioritized plan provides a structured path for testing `FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser` in a systematic manner. By addressing core functionality and stability first, the plan helps ensure each testing task effectively supports reliable and resilient parser development.
