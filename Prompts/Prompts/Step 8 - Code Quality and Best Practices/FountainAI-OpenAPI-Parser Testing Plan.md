# ðŸ“‹ Structured Testing Plan for FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser: Issue Tracker

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for `FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser`, with each task directly related to an issue for streamlined tracking and resolution. This approach ensures that every aspect of testingâ€”mocking, core functionality, utilities, integration, and exception handlingâ€”is systematically addressed.

## 1. Mocking Strategy for External Dependencies

> **Objective**: Establish test isolation by mocking external dependencies, ensuring tests are deterministic and independent of external resources.

- **Identify External Dependencies for Mocking**
  - **Action**: Review `utils.py` and `parser.py` for any external calls, such as network requests or file I/O operations.

- **Set Up Mocking for Identified Dependencies**
  - **Action**: Implement mocks for dependencies identified in the previous step, using `unittest.mock` for external calls.

- **Document Mocking Strategy**
  - **Action**: Update `FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser Testing Plan.md` to describe the mocking approach, including examples for consistent implementation.

- **Verify Effectiveness of Mock Isolation**
  - **Action**: Run all tests to confirm that mocks are effectively isolating external dependencies.

## 2. Parser Core Functionality Tests

> **Objective**: Thoroughly test core parser functions to ensure they handle diverse OpenAPI structures and edge cases accurately.

- **Expand Basic Parsing Tests in Parser Core**
  - **Action**: Add cases to `test_parser.py` that validate basic parsing of `openapi.yaml` for standard OpenAPI documents.

- **Add Path and Method Parsing Tests**
  - **Action**: Include tests for multiple HTTP methods within a single path to ensure comprehensive path parsing.

- **Develop Schema Validation Tests for Parser Core**
  - **Action**: Validate the parserâ€™s handling of different schema types, such as arrays, objects, and custom definitions.

- **Add Nested Path Parsing Tests**
  - **Action**: Expand tests in `test_parser.py` to verify accurate parsing of nested paths and references.

- **Expand Tests for Invalid Structure Handling**
  - **Action**: Test for appropriate error handling when parsing structurally invalid OpenAPI documents using `invalid_openapi.yaml`.

---

## 3. Utility Function Tests

> **Objective**: Ensure all utility functions are robust and can handle various input types, references, and complex path manipulations.

- **Expand Schema Conversion Tests in Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Add test cases in `test_utils.py` to verify schema conversion functions handle all input types accurately.

- **Develop Reference Resolution Tests for Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Expand tests for `$ref` handling, covering both nested and recursive references.

- **Add Path Manipulation Tests for Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Test the utility functions' handling of complex path structures.

- **Implement Edge Case Tests for Utility Functions**
  - **Action**: Add tests for unusual or unexpected inputs to verify that utility functions are resilient.

---

## 4. Integration Tests for Full Parser Workflow

> **Objective**: Confirm that the entire parser workflow can handle full OpenAPI documents, nested structures, and error cases.

- **Expand Integration Tests for Full OpenAPI File Parsing**
  - **Action**: Add end-to-end tests to `test_integration.py` to validate complete OpenAPI 3.1 documents.

- **Develop Nested Reference Parsing Tests**
  - **Action**: Ensure the parser accurately resolves deep and recursive `$ref` references within the full document.

- **Develop Error Handling Tests for Integration Workflow**
  - **Action**: Add tests that validate the parserâ€™s error handling for invalid or partially valid documents.

- **Add Parameter and Response Extraction Tests**
  - **Action**: Confirm that the parser accurately extracts parameters and responses from the document.

---

## 5. Exception Handling Tests

> **Objective**: Ensure each custom exception in `exceptions.py` is correctly raised, with clear and informative error messages.

- **Test Each Custom Exception for Error Handling**
  - **Action**: Write tests for each custom exception to verify accurate error handling in `exceptions.py`.

- **Add Scenario-Based Tests for Exception Handling**
  - **Action**: Develop tests in `test_parser.py` and `test_utils.py` that trigger each custom exception in various scenarios.
