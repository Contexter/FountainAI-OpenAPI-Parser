## 1. Mocking Strategy for External Dependencies

> **Objective**: Establish test isolation by mocking external dependencies, ensuring tests are deterministic and independent of external resources.

- **[Identify External Dependencies for Mocking](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/1)**
  - **Action**: Review `utils.py` and `parser.py` for any external calls, such as network requests or file I/O operations.

- **[Set Up Mocking for Identified Dependencies](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/2)**
  - **Action**: Implement mocks for dependencies identified in the previous step, using `unittest.mock` for external calls.

- **[Document Mocking Strategy](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/3)**
  - **Action**: Update `FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser Testing Plan.md` to describe the mocking approach, including examples for consistent implementation.

- **[Verify Effectiveness of Mock Isolation](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/4)**
  - **Action**: Run all tests to confirm that mocks are effectively isolating external dependencies.

## 2. Parser Core Functionality Tests

> **Objective**: Thoroughly test core parser functions to ensure they handle diverse OpenAPI structures and edge cases accurately.

- **[Expand Basic Parsing Tests in Parser Core](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/5)**
  - **Action**: Add cases to `test_parser.py` that validate basic parsing of `openapi.yaml` for standard OpenAPI documents.

- **[Add Path and Method Parsing Tests](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/6)**
  - **Action**: Include tests for multiple HTTP methods within a single path to ensure comprehensive path parsing.

- **[Develop Schema Validation Tests for Parser Core](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/7)**
  - **Action**: Validate the parserâ€™s handling of different schema types, such as arrays, objects, and custom definitions.

- **[Add Nested Path Parsing Tests](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/8)**
  - **Action**: Expand tests in `test_parser.py` to verify accurate parsing of nested paths and references.

- **[Expand Tests for Invalid Structure Handling](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/9)**
  - **Action**: Test for appropriate error handling when parsing structurally invalid OpenAPI documents using `invalid_openapi.yaml`.

---

## 3. Utility Function Tests

> **Objective**: Ensure all utility functions are robust and can handle various input types, references, and complex path manipulations.

- **[Expand Schema Conversion Tests in Utility Functions](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/10)**
  - **Action**: Add test cases in `test_utils.py` to verify schema conversion functions handle all input types accurately.

- **[Develop Reference Resolution Tests for Utility Functions](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/11)**
  - **Action**: Expand tests for `$ref` handling, covering both nested and recursive references.

- **[Add Path Manipulation Tests for Utility Functions](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/12)**
  - **Action**: Test the utility functions' handling of complex path structures.

- **[Implement Edge Case Tests for Utility Functions](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/13)**
  - **Action**: Add tests for unusual or unexpected inputs to verify that utility functions are resilient.

---

## 4. Integration Tests for Full Parser Workflow

> **Objective**: Confirm that the entire parser workflow can handle full OpenAPI documents, nested structures, and error cases.

- **[Expand Integration Tests for Full OpenAPI File Parsing](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/14)**
  - **Action**: Add end-to-end tests to `test_integration.py` to validate complete OpenAPI 3.1 documents.

- **[Develop Nested Reference Parsing Tests](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/15)**
  - **Action**: Ensure the parser accurately resolves deep and recursive `$ref` references within the full document.

- **[Develop Error Handling Tests for Integration Workflow](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/16)**
  - **Action**: Add tests that validate the parserâ€™s error handling for invalid or partially valid documents.

- **[Add Parameter and Response Extraction Tests](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/17)**
  - **Action**: Confirm that the parser accurately extracts parameters and responses from the document.

---

## 5. Exception Handling Tests

> **Objective**: Ensure each custom exception in `exceptions.py` is correctly raised, with clear and informative error messages.

- **[Test Each Custom Exception for Error Handling](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/18)**
  - **Action**: Write tests for each custom exception to verify accurate error handling in `exceptions.py`.

- **[Add Scenario-Based Tests for Exception Handling](https://github.com/Contexter/FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser/issues/19)**
  - **Action**: Develop tests in `test_parser.py` and `test_utils.py` that trigger each custom exception in various scenarios.
