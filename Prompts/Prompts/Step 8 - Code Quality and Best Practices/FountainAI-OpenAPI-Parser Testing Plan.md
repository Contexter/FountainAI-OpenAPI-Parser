## 1. Implement Mocking Strategy for External Dependencies

> **Objective**: Isolate tests from external dependencies to ensure they run deterministically in any environment.

### Existing Files to Leverage
- `fountainai_openapi_parser/utils.py`: Likely contains utility functions that may interface with external resources.
- `tests/test_utils.py`: Unit tests for `utils.py` functions. Could be expanded to include mock dependencies where applicable.

### Action Plan
- **[ ] Identify Dependencies**: Review functions in `utils.py` and `parser.py` to identify any external calls (e.g., network requests, file I/O) that require mocking.
  
- **[ ] Set Up Mocks**:
  - Use libraries like `unittest.mock` to replace external calls with mocks.
  - Specifically mock any file operations in `test_utils.py` to prevent direct file system access.
  
- **[ ] Document Mocking Approach**:
  - Update the existing `FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser Testing Plan.md` in `Prompts/Prompts/Step 8` to describe the mocking strategy, including how to add new mocks.
  
- **[ ] Verify Mocks**:
  - Ensure all external interactions are mocked by running tests in isolation, simulating different scenarios without relying on real resources.

## 2. Enhance Test Coverage for Parser Core Functionality

> **Objective**: Increase coverage of core parser functions, especially for essential OpenAPI parsing.

### Existing Files to Leverage
- `fountainai_openapi_parser/parser.py`: Core parser implementation for OpenAPI.
- `tests/test_parser.py`: Unit tests for the parser, likely covering basic and some edge cases.

### Action Plan
- **[ ] Basic Parsing**:
  - Expand `test_parser.py` to cover additional simple OpenAPI files (`tests/data/openapi.yaml`).
  
- **[ ] Path and Method Parsing**:
  - Extend tests in `test_parser.py` to cover multiple HTTP methods within a single path.
  - Include example OpenAPI files (e.g., `tests/data/invalid_openapi.yaml`) to simulate real-world API definitions.
  
- **[ ] Schema and Nested Parsing**:
  - Add more complex schemas to `openapi.yaml`, including nested paths and object schemas.
  - Test complex schemas directly in `test_parser.py` and verify all attributes and references resolve correctly.

- **[ ] Invalid Structure Handling**:
  - Expand `tests/data/invalid_openapi.yaml` with variations of common structural errors (e.g., missing keys, incorrect types) and confirm error handling in `test_parser.py`.

---

## 3. Expand Unit Tests for Utility Functions

> **Objective**: Enhance robustness and edge case handling within `utils.py`.

### Existing Files to Leverage
- `fountainai_openapi_parser/utils.py`: Utility functions to support parsing.
- `tests/test_utils.py`: Existing test file for utilities, likely covering basic utility function tests.

### Action Plan
- **[ ] Schema Conversion Tests**:
  - Identify conversion functions in `utils.py` and add schema type tests.
  - Use variations from `tests/data/external_schema.yaml` for schema conversion edge cases.
  
- **[ ] Reference Resolution**:
  - Confirm handling of `$ref` resolution within utility functions.
  - Add nested and recursive `$ref` scenarios in test cases to ensure correct function.
  
- **[ ] Path Manipulation**:
  - Expand `test_utils.py` with test cases that simulate complex path structures (from `openapi.yaml`).

## 4. Add Integration Tests for Full Parser Workflow

> **Objective**: Validate end-to-end parsing of OpenAPI documents using integration tests.

### Existing Files to Leverage
- `tests/test_integration.py`: Likely exists for end-to-end testing of the parser on full OpenAPI documents.

### Action Plan
- **[ ] Full Document Parsing**:
  - Expand `test_integration.py` with additional OpenAPI samples to test comprehensive parsing (e.g., external references, complex schemas).
  
- **[ ] Nested and Recursive References**:
  - Simulate deep `$ref` chains within `tests/data/openapi.yaml` and confirm accurate parsing.
  
- **[ ] Error Handling Across Workflow**:
  - Test invalid documents with different error types to validate parser robustness.
  - Ensure `test_integration.py` triggers appropriate error handling responses.

---

## 5. Enhance Exception Handling Tests

> **Objective**: Ensure meaningful error handling for all custom exceptions, facilitating debugging.

### Existing Files to Leverage
- `fountainai_openapi_parser/exceptions.py`: Custom exception classes for parsing errors.
- `tests/test_parser.py` and `tests/test_utils.py`: Extend these files to include exception-specific tests.

### Action Plan
- **[ ] Custom Exception Testing**:
  - Review each class in `exceptions.py`, identify unique error scenarios, and create unit tests to validate each exception type.
  
- **[ ] Scenario-Based Error Handling**:
  - Add cases in `test_parser.py` and `test_utils.py` that trigger exceptions.
  - Confirm that each exception provides a clear error message and does not stop the test suite unexpectedly.

---

## 6. Implement Code Coverage and Reporting

> **Objective**: Integrate continuous code coverage reporting into CI/CD to monitor test effectiveness.

### Existing Files to Leverage
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD, which can be expanded to include coverage reporting.
- `FountainAI-OpenAPI-Parser Testing Plan.md`: Update this file with details on the coverage strategy.

### Action Plan
- **[ ] Set Up Coverage Tool**:
  - Install `coverage.py` and configure it to report on `fountainai_openapi_parser/` and `tests/`.
  
- **[ ] CI Integration**:
  - Update `ci.yml` to include a step that generates and reports coverage results.
  
- **[ ] Generate Detailed Coverage Reports**:
  - Ensure reports include breakdowns by module and line coverage, highlighting gaps.
  
- **[ ] Coverage Badge in README**:
  - Add a badge to `README.md` showing the latest coverage percentage, ensuring it updates automatically.

- **[ ] Set Coverage Thresholds**:
  - Configure the CI workflow to fail if coverage drops below a certain threshold, maintaining test standards.

This plan addresses specific testing needs within the repositoryâ€™s current structure and content, establishing a clear path to ensure high test coverage, isolated tests, and reliable error handling. This approach not only boosts confidence in the parserâ€™s functionality but also lays a solid foundation for future maintenance and improvements.
