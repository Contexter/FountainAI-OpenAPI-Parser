# Canvas Sessions Plan for Implementing `parser.py`

To develop `parser.py` effectively, we will use the canvas to manage each file and component through multiple focused sessions. Here is a structured plan detailing how we'll create and organize the different files, along with the corresponding canvas documents for a streamlined and efficient development process.

## **1. Stage-by-Stage Breakdown of Development**

The implementation process for `parser.py` involves multiple interrelated components. Each stage of development will have its own canvas session, allowing us to create, refine, and integrate individual files.

### **Stage 1: Core Parsing Logic in `parser.py`**
- **Canvas Document**: Create a document named `parser.py`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop the `parse_openapi()` function to handle both YAML and JSON formats.
  - Implement logic to detect the format based on file content or extension.
  - Add functionality for handling `$ref` references, including both local and external references.
  - Ensure integration with utility functions from `utils.py`.

### **Stage 2: Utility Functions in `utils.py`**
- **Canvas Document**: Create a document named `utils.py`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Develop reusable helper functions, such as `load_file()` for reading file content and `is_yaml()` for format detection.
  - Add any other functions needed by `parser.py`, such as support for reference resolution or caching.
  - Ensure these functions are modular and reusable for other parts of the project.

### **Stage 3: Custom Exception Handling in `exceptions.py`**
- **Canvas Document**: Create a document named `exceptions.py`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Define custom exceptions such as `ParsingError`, `ReferenceResolutionError`, and `ValidationError`.
  - Ensure these exceptions are used appropriately in `parser.py` to provide meaningful error messages during parsing.
  - Organize the exception handling logic for maintainability and clarity.

### **Stage 4: Testing in `test_parser.py`**
- **Canvas Document**: Create a document named `test_parser.py`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Write unit tests to cover the functionality in `parser.py`, focusing on scenarios like:
    - Successful parsing of valid OpenAPI documents.
    - Handling invalid documents and ensuring appropriate exceptions are raised.
    - Resolving both local and external `$ref` references, including circular references.
  - Add tests for utility functions in `utils.py`.
  - Aim for comprehensive test coverage, ensuring reliability.

### **Stage 5: Integration and Logging Configuration in `__init__.py`**
- **Canvas Document**: Create a document named `__init__.py`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Integrate `parser.py` and `utils.py` into the main package.
  - Configure logging to provide debug, info, warning, and error messages during the parsing process.
  - Include functions to allow users to set the logging level easily.

### **Stage 6: Documentation Updates and Usage Examples**
- **Canvas Document**: Create a document for updating `README.md`.
- **Tasks**:
  - Update the `README.md` files to provide examples of how to use `parser.py`.
  - Add detailed descriptions and usage examples for the main functions.
  - Update the prompt in `Prompts/Prompts/Step 3 - Add Parsing Functions in parser.py/README.md` to reflect the implementation details and changes.

## **2. Leveraging Canvas for Each Module**

Using canvas sessions for each of the above stages allows us to:

- **Focus on Specific Components**: Develop each file in isolation to maintain clarity and ensure that all requirements are met.
- **Iterate and Refine**: Make changes iteratively, focusing on specific tasks within each module without overwhelming the overall development process.
- **Cross-Reference Easily**: When changes are made in one file, they can be easily referenced and updated in other related files using separate canvas sessions.

## **3. Example Workflow Using the Canvas**

1. **Step 1: Develop `parser.py`**
   - Create a canvas document for `parser.py`.
   - Define the `parse_openapi()` function, initially focusing on handling both JSON and YAML formats.
   - Add reference resolution logic and ensure integration with utilities from `utils.py`.

2. **Step 2: Develop Utilities in `utils.py`**
   - Create a separate canvas document for `utils.py`.
   - Add functions such as `load_file()` to read content from files and format detection helpers.
   - Refine these functions as needed, based on their usage in `parser.py`.

3. **Step 3: Create Custom Exceptions in `exceptions.py`**
   - Create a canvas document for `exceptions.py`.
   - Define exceptions that provide clear and specific error messages.
   - Reference these exceptions in `parser.py` to improve error handling.

4. **Step 4: Write Tests in `test_parser.py`**
   - Create a canvas document for `test_parser.py`.
   - Develop unit tests to validate parsing functionality, focusing on various edge cases and scenarios.

5. **Step 5: Integration with `__init__.py`**
   - Create a canvas document for `__init__.py`.
   - Configure logging and integrate the components developed so far into the main package.

6. **Step 6: Documentation Updates**
   - Create or edit a canvas document for `README.md`.
   - Document how to use `parser.py`, add examples, and provide explanations for each function.

## **4. Handling Cross-Module Dependencies**

- **Updating Across Modules**: When new utility functions are added in `utils.py`, update `parser.py` accordingly in its canvas document.
- **Notes and Placeholders**: Use placeholders in each canvas document to indicate where changes in another file might be required.

## **Summary**

By using this structured approach, each canvas session will focus on a specific aspect of the `parser.py` implementation, from core parsing logic and utilities to error handling and testing. This modular approach ensures clarity, easier maintenance, and effective integration across all project components.
